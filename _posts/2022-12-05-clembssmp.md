this friday 9/12, [Clembs](http:/clembs.com/)'s SMP, advertised on his [discord server](http://clembs.com/discord), will launch @ 19:00 GMT (20:00 CET, 22:00 MSK, 14:00 EST). for the occasion, he will organize a stream on his [twitch](https://twitch.tv/clembs).

i will be on his stream along with many other people, including:
* DankNil (on the server more than on stream)
* [Kutomi1](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQlEv2kwjHK4u8da5amCOlw)

* [Username5522](https://user5522.tk/)
* [Super Knuckles](soupahknuckles)

i will also stream for the occasion on *my* [twitch](https://twitch.tv/mizuofficialontwitch). here is how the stream ***should*** go:
* T -30min: stream start
* T -15min: coming on stream
* before server opening: hopping in stream VC
* T  -5min: opening and streaming the game
* T       : hopping on the server and playing with our faction (Hydranation)
* no idea when the stream ends, but on my part it will end before or at T +3h

you read it, it's basically like the web, except it's piss simple, only has one request type, and is really easy to implement (assuming you are using Mayernet 1, without encryption)

Mayernet uses `json` to transmit metadata and `markdown` as markup language of choice. this makes it very easy to render documents

it's an extremely simple and light protocol so it's really piss easy to implement; it has an extremely simple format. it uses newlines to separate fields such as in the client->server request (URL + newline + BODY)

it's made to be extremely quick to grasp and understand, even as a human user looking through TCP socket conversations (though i'll have to admit it's kind of a problem: it's not only easy to parse for clients, it also is for snitches!)

so yeah Mayernet 1 does not include encryption yet, but you may propose a way to implement encryption in the protocol.

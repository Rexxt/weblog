today, friday 7th october 2022, marks the beginning of my linux journey.
i will edit this article as time goes on to let you know about what's happening

* 17h57 CEST: about to boot to Nobara Linux using my USB, backing everything up from windows to my d drive
* 20h03 CEST: Nobara Linux is running, battling to get it to write to my d drive because right now it's in read only mode for whatever reason, i just hope it'll be over soon because i'm about to fucking cry

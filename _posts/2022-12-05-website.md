this morning, i've started to completely redesign my [website](https://rexxt.github.io/). it should bring a couple improvements, including:

* more content
* *actually* responsive design
* working design at that
* cleaner interface

here's a general idea for the timeline:

* [x] 5/12 morning: draft the project
* [X] 5/12 morning-5/12 afternoon: write the content
* [X] 5/12 evening-6/12 afternoon: test the website on pc and mobile
* [X] 5/12 evening-6/12 afternoon: pushing the website

do note that the timeline is not 100% indicative of what is *actually* going to happen in the coming days, however the website should be fully released around the weekend (10/12-11/12)

edit: it took me over a month lmao
anyway it's online now

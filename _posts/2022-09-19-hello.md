hello and welcome to my blog where I can post without having to worry about the GAFAMs beating me up (yes, I know github is owned by a GAFAM, but this blog will move over to my own raspberry pi soon)

cbf to capitalize and punctuate sentences correctly, don't expect much of this blog (or me, generally)

if you want to know more about me, check [my website](https://rexxt.github.io/), but for now here's a quick summary:
* French
* developer
* writes tiny, fast and extensible software
* contributor to the open source community
* loves to tinker around with small, usually Python/Bash projects such as [tifm](https://github.com/Rexxt/tifm) (which is also a very good example of the tiny, fast and extensible software philosophy)
